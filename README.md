# 1. EXPERIMENT 1
## Aim:
To demonstrate the basic structure of a C++ program and the syntax for outputting text to the console.

## Theory:
The "Hello, World!" program is a classic first exercise for learning any programming language. It showcases the essential syntax and structure of a C++ program. In C++, the #include <iostream> directive is used to include the standard input-output stream library, which allows the program to use std::cout for outputting text to the console. The main function is the entry point of every C++ program. Inside the main function, std::cout << "Hello, World!"; sends the string "Hello, World!" to the standard output (usually the console), followed by std::endl which ends the line. This program introduces basic concepts such as headers, namespaces, the main function, and output statements.

## Apparatus: 
VS Code, Github

## Conclusion:
The "Hello, World!" program serves as an introductory exercise for learning the fundamental syntax and structure of C++. It provides a straightforward example of how to output text to the console and is a foundational step for understanding more complex programming concepts.





# 2. EXPERIMENT 2
## Aim:
To perform basic arithmetic operations and number classifications by calculating the sum, average, and determining whether numbers are even or odd.

## Theory:
This program covers several foundational concepts in C++:

### Arithmetic Operations:
Basic arithmetic operations include addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. These operations are performed using operators like +, -, *, and /. The program calculates the sum and average of a series of numbers, demonstrating how to perform and combine arithmetic operations.

### Conditional Statements:
Conditional operators are used to make decisions in the program. For instance, the modulus operator % is used to determine if a number is even or odd. Conditional statements such as if and else help in branching the program flow based on whether the condition is true or false.

### Input/Output Operations:
The program uses std::cin to take input from the user and std::cout to display output. This interaction is essential for creating dynamic programs that can handle user-provided data.

## Apparatus:
VS Code, Github

## Conclusion:
The program provides practical experience with fundamental C++ concepts, including arithmetic operations and conditional logic. By calculating and classifying numbers, users gain insight into basic programming techniques and how to handle user input effectively. This exercise helps in understanding how to perform and manage basic computations and decision-making in C++.





# 3. EXPERIMENT 3.
## Aim:
To illustrate the use of arithmetic operators, assignment operators, and conditional operators in C++.

## Theory:
This program demonstrates the use of different types of operators in C++:

### Arithmetic Operators:
These include + (addition), - (subtraction), * (multiplication), / (division), and % (modulus). They are used to perform basic mathematical operations on numeric data types.

### Assignment Operators:
These operators are used to assign values to variables. The basic assignment operator = assigns a value to a variable, while compound assignment operators like +=, -=, *=, and /= combine arithmetic operations with assignment.

### Conditional (Relational) Operators:
These include == (equality), != (inequality), > (greater than), < (less than), >= (greater than or equal to), and <= (less than or equal to). They are used to compare values and produce Boolean results (true or false).

### Logical Operators:
These operators are used to combine multiple Boolean expressions. They include && (logical AND), || (logical OR), and ! (logical NOT). Logical operators are crucial for controlling the flow of the program based on multiple conditions.

## Apparatus:
VS Code,Github

## Conclusion:
This program provides a comprehensive overview of how different types of operators are used in C++. Understanding these operators is crucial for performing various operations, manipulating data, and implementing logic in C++ programs. This file serves as a practical guide for beginners to get familiar with operators and their applications in programming.
